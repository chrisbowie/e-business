								<p>Selling a house is a daunting task in the life of any individual. You are faced with finding a new house, fixing any defects present in the house and deciding whether or not you would like to hire a real estate agent. It seems nonsensical to hire a real estate agent as this has become the norm in recent times. However, careful consideration should go into this decision as just because it is the norm does not mean it may be the best decision for your particular situation.</p>

<p>As with any profession, there are excellent as well as lackluster people in the field. Finding a very good real estate agent could make the decision easy and advantageous to you, so going on a website like<a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Zillow.com&nbsp;</a>will help you find reviews on real estate agents in your local area. Conducting research can save you valuable time and effort in finding a good real estate agent that has a good reputation amongst peers and clients.</p>

<p>The advantages of hiring a real estate agent can be plentiful providing you find the right one. The possible advantages of hiring a real estate agent include:</p>

<h3>Saves time and effort</h3>

<p>Selling a house requires you to devote a lot of time and effort which many people simply do not have. You may have to organize and lead viewings and tours of the house, find someone to value the property, deal with potential clients and manage negotiations with them, oversee safety inspections and listing your house on various websites. Hiring an estate agent takes away some, if not all, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterteam.com/real-estate-agent-job-description" target="_blank">responsibilities</a>&nbsp;in selling a house. The duties listed above are the main duties of an estate agent, so leaving things in their hands may prove to be the most beneficial option.</p>

<h3>Avoiding large amounts of paperwork</h3>

<p>A highly trained real estate agent has experience in dealing with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lawtang.com/buying-house-buyer/" target="_blank">legal contracts</a>&nbsp;required to list as well as sell a house. An experienced real estate agent will handle the legalities and ensure that the sale of your house is done without any problems or mishaps. While an agent can be useful for this, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smallbusinessattorneynyc.com/practice-areas/real-estate-lawyer/" target="_blank">real estate attorney</a>&nbsp;is also very likely to be important and useful for any contractual matters as it concerns the sale of the property. Therefore, all efforts must be made to make sure that you have one on your team for the transaction.</p>

<h3>Having someone experienced to conduct negotiations</h3>

<p>Negotiating in any field of expertise can prove to be a difficult task but it becomes all the more important when you are&nbsp;<a href="https://theclose.com/real-estate-negotiation/" target="_blank">negotiating the sale</a>&nbsp;of a highly valued asset such as your house. If you are inexperienced in negotiating then hiring a real estate agent should definitely be the route you should take. A good real estate agent will negotiate on your behalf which could ensure that you complete the main objective of selling your house: maximizing your profit. To do this a real estate agent may be useful as having a well-respected real estate agent will discourage potential buyers from trying to scam you with a low offer.</p>

<h3>Getting your home in the best shape possible</h3>

<p>An established real estate agent usually has connections that could be useful in getting your home in the best shape possible. They may provide you with inspectors, designers and contractors, who could help to improve the state of your home. Appearance is everything in the real estate business and having a house that blows away potential buyers could prove to be all the bargaining power you need in negotiations.</p>

<h3>Having an expert in your market</h3>

<p>Finding a qualified real estate agent that knows your local market is extremely beneficial. The agent will know the best ways to advertise your home, set an appropriate price as well as conclude the sale of your house as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a real estate agent is not necessary for everybody looking to sell their house and if you are able to successfully complete some of the tasks that a real estate agent can do then hiring one is simply not necessary. If you are faced with a situation in which there are no reliable real estate agents in your area then proceeding without a real estate agent is most probably the best option for you. Some of the disadvantages of using a real estate agent to sell your home include:</p>

<h3>Paying Commission</h3>

<p>Hiring an experienced real estate agent can often be a little bit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.property24.com/articles/estate-agents-commission-explained/17519" target="_blank">expensive</a>&nbsp;especially if you do not have the budget for it. Estate agents sometimes charge up to 6% of the total sale price of the house. This amount can prove to be adding thousands of dollars on top of expenses such as general housekeeping. If you are able to avoid this then selling your home by yourself is the best option.</p>

<h3>Having to adapt to someone else&rsquo;s timeline</h3>

<p>If you end up hiring a real estate agent you may have to adapt your sale to the schedule of the agent. This is because real estate agents have many clients and they may not be able to sell your home as quickly as you&rsquo;d like or wait long enough for the value of the home to increase before selling. This is could be detrimental as you may not be able to maximize your profits or properly plan what your next move may be after selling your home.</p>

<h3>Value of the house</h3>

<p>People value items differently than others. This can be problematic when you are deciding at what price to sell your house. A real estate agent may not value your home as much as you value it or even to market value, this could result in you not maximize your profits or even losing money during the sale.</p>

<p>Although it may seem like a no-brainer to hire a real estate agent, your decision should be entirely based on your knowledge of the real estate market as well as your current</p>
