								<p>Customers are regular people with feelings and lives to live. They need to feel special and required by your business, and not as money minting machines. Therefore, you have to create a connection with them and not merely focus on selling yourself out. So whatever you do should positively contribute to the growth of your business. Be it the way you answer those frequent phone calls, how you draft emails or even present yourself through your blog posts.</p>

<p>
Over the past few years, <u><a href="https://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/inbound-marketing.html" target="_blank">inbound marketing</a></u> has been used by small and large-scale businesses as one of the best ways to maintain and grow its market share. Why? Because if done right, you wouldn&#39;t have to go out there, sourcing for clients. They will instead be the ones searching for you. All you will have to do is attract, and captivate them to keep coming back for more.</p>

<p>If you want to understand inbound, think of it as a mastered art that you can learn and effectively combine with other marketing efforts (such as SEO tactics) to enhance your business&#39;s attractiveness to prospective clients searching for various critical terms on the internet.</p>

<p><img src="https://christurner.my-free.website/x/cdn/?https://storage.googleapis.com/production-websitebuilder-v1-0-5/955/513955/ofFULatY/4db1c192952445ad8e4eaaf4df652ccd" style="height:310px; width:310px" /></p>

<p>
Sounds too good to be true? Absolutely not. You have to focus your mind on the correct approaches, such as incorporating marketing content that your targeted audience will appreciate, love, and want to share. That&#39;s where the various inbound marketing models come in to help businesses benefit from their happy customers&#39; mouth-to-mouth referrals.
</p>
One such famous inbound marketing model is the funnel, which has been outstanding over the years. But even so, its effectiveness seems to be on a constant drop due to misplaced priorities as per the current times; customers are more valued than the sales and marketing outcomes that the funnel focuses on.<br />
<br />
This is seemingly forcing marketers to discard the inbound marketing funnel and adopt the flywheel visualization, which gives clients the attention they deserve, even after-sales.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Why Should you Consider the Inbound Marketing Flywheel?</strong><br />
The inbound marketing flywheel is a creation of HubSpot&#39;s co-founder Brian Halligan, also famously referred to as the backbone of inbound marketing. Although there are many similarities with the funnel approach, the flywheel is an upgraded version, bringing more to the table, focusing on customer needs instead of sales and marketing outcomes.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the inbound flywheel model is a client-oriented strategy where marketers focus mainly on the Delight stage, which would otherwise be the last on the funnel. The results? Happy customers, who turn out as willful promoters, meaning more active sales leads and increased website traffic.<br />
<br />
When using the flywheel model, you want to provide the best customer service experience to your customers. There shouldn&#39;t be any room for complaint, and all clients should be fully satisfied, become regulars, and even encourage others to seek you out.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Think of it as the same way you would readily recommend your business attorney to others if you received superb services. Anyone within their circle is likely to visit your website to confirm what they have been told. You will then take advantage of this and provide highly engaging and attractive marketing content, which will turn visitors into viable leads and, finally, regular clients if delivered well.<br />
<br />
Afterward, you will be standing by with an outstanding after-sell customer service experience that will also convert them into your business&#39;s willful promoters. And the circle continues. You see, if you have many happy customers, you will also enjoy the services of numerous cheerful &quot;unpaid&quot; promoters. More sales translate to faster business growth, which is to your advantage. This is the flywheel&#39;s true meaning; to take &quot;advantage&quot; of your customers&#39; satisfaction to grow.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So as you can see, your business gains massively when you effectively use the inbound methodology and the flywheel.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>How Can Inbound and Flywheel Marketing Grow your Business?</strong><br />
According to <u><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?__hstc=195507827.1cb32775fc8a7a431a3532546ac1f6aa.1604387445291.1604387445291.1604394623013.2&amp;__hssc=195507827.1.1604394623013&amp;__hsfp=3231059665" target="_blank">HubSpot</a></u>, &quot;The new inbound methodology is a circle. When you use the inbound methodology as a foundation, the three phases of your flywheel are; attract, engage, and delight. By applying force to these three phases, you can provide an amazing customer experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s examine how this is possible using the three mentioned new inbound phases (Attract, Engage, and Delight)<br />
<br />
<strong>Attract Phase</strong><br />
During the attraction phase, your marketing team&#39;s primary focus should be to create valuable content to help customers learn more about your business.&nbsp;But even as you do so, you don&#39;t want to seem desperate for attention. You want people to visit your site willingly, depending on how you present yourself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Therefore, at this stage, it&#39;s advisable to put forward your best content marketing tactics combined with other active promotion forces such as SEO, placement of paid ads, social media marketing, and much more.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Engage Phase</strong><br />
You make yourself strategically available and accessible by customers of all dynamics. For example, you incorporate flexibility in your operation time, keeping in mind the different time zones of your potential customers (that&#39;s if you&#39;re targeting worldwide sales). Also, you have no problem being present in various social media channels for easy reach and interaction.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here, your primary agenda should be to form and maintain relationships with your clients such that they will feel addicted to your business. Becoming their number one go-to site whenever they need a service or product in your operation line should be your primary priority.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s so much you can do to achieve continuous engagement. From personalizing your messages, dividing customers into various segments depending on their preferences, to adopting multiple communication channels, to mention but a few. You need to know what works for them and keep retesting over time with your customer base&#39;s growth.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Delight Phase</strong><br />
At this stage, you work with your customers, provide them with all the necessary guidance, and unlimited support to actualize their objectives. If your clients are doing better in life, you will also reap the benefits. People will want to know what their secret is, and they will lead them back to you. There&#39;re many ways you can ensure this, including, but not limited to, automated services, frequent opinion polls, multiple communication systems, among others.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When you begin to focus more on customer satisfaction, you cut down misunderstandings, increase the chances of retaining new-found customers, the existing ones, and attract more leads.&nbsp;Remember, everyone in the business gets involved in customer service provision in the inbound and flywheel model. They all know the importance of attracting, engaging, and delighting customers to benefit the whole organization. It&#39;s a team effort seeking to bring optimum holistic experiences.<br />
<br />
<strong>How Can You Practically Apply this?</strong><br />
<strong>Research</strong><br />
You need to know what you&#39;re getting into and if inbound and flywheel marketing is what your business needs at the moment. How? Conduct thorough research:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To find out why your previous content marketing efforts failed.</li>
	<li>Which objectives do you want to achieve that you weren&#39;t able to before? Remember, your goals should always be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely) just the same way objectives are vital when establish an LLC or a corporation.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Come-up with a Flywheel</strong><br />
There&#39;s no constant viable flywheel for all businesses. They each have different needs. So restrain from copy-pasting what others around you are doing. For instance, you could have different target audiences, products/services, and even operation models.<br />
<br />
Once you identify your business&#39;s unique attributes, you can go ahead and create a flywheel. Remember to include all essential departments in your organization. They each need to drive a wheel, which can ensure holistic customer satisfaction and, thus, your overall business goal when combined with various inbound activities.<br />
Prioritize<br />
<br />
Yes, you might have compiled many possible actionable items from your departmental meetings, but that doesn&#39;t mean you apply them all at once. Instead, pick a few according to their importance and try them out.&nbsp; It could be upgrading your <u><a href="https://www.comm100.com/blog/top-types-of-customer-communication-channels.html" target="_blank">communication channels</a></u>, increasing working hours, improving your product quality, and much more. Whatever can solve the numerous complaints/low ratings you&#39;ve been receiving should be prioritized.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the best combination of the flywheel is in inbound marketing. The reason is that It is more flexible and can easily accommodate the changing customer needs, which should be the focus of any growth-seeking organization. With consumers at the center of service provision, they enjoy a delightful and holistic experience, translating to word-of-mouth promotions and referrals for your business.<br />
<br />
There you have it. Now that you have all you require to revolutionize your business, it&rsquo;s time to swing into action-create that inbound and flywheel marketing strategy, and start reaping the long-term unwavering benefits!</p>
