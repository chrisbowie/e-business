								<p>Over the years as new businesses were launched by entrepreneurs with massive dreams and even bigger visions, they failed to realize there are many regulations one needs to be familiar with when starting up or founding a business. Traditional law firms weren&rsquo;t designed to give the entrepreneur the kind of legal advice he required, let alone help to set up the right business structure. Thus, many businesses were trying to jump legal hurdles but failed and took their fledgling businesses into the annals of deep financial ruin.</p>

<p>It was bankruptcy before they even got off the ground. Then someone with nous, a legal background with a futuristic approach and a heck of a lot of initiative and common sense saw the plight of the entrepreneur and decided to do something irrevocable.</p>

<p>Introductions weren&#39;t formally made as a startup business lawyer paved the road for others who would inevitably follow in his fortuitous footsteps. He would guide the businessman through the steps required to make his venture not only viable but legal as well. It was vital that the newcomer into any corporation or business ensured he had the correct legal documentation in hand together with someone who knew the law in his chosen field &ndash; entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>It was also critical that this person knew that when disputes arose as they can in any business, the complexities of having raised capital to float the venture were not jeopardized and that the intellectual property was protected at all times. There was much to consider. Startup law matters included an assurance that a business was set up as a business structure and that all founders and key team members were included in a Shareholder&#39;s Agreement drafted by a legal firm. If there was an incentive scheme for employees, it was drawn up correctly and legally and it was introduced through the relevant Employee Share Option Plan.</p>

<p>All drafted legal documents reflected that the business was either online or was conducting business through an e-commerce website, and any trademark, brand or logo registration would sufficiently protect the intellectual property and other interests. Any capital and external funding raised, or any funds that used grants and any equity financing, convertible notes, debt financing and revenue loans was dealt with legally and professionally, and any buying or selling of a business could be dealt with under the same advice rather than splitting costs with a business broker.</p>

<p>That any employment and or business structuring, all commercial leasing or contract negotiations, required loans, trademarks and disputes could also be dealt with under the same roof. In all, the SAFE contract which stands for &quot;Simple Agreement for Future Equity&quot; would remain in place. And so the trend was launched and sought after. Suddenly there were people who not only knew what they were doing as far as legalities were concerned, but the costs to hire them far outweighed those often charged by a divorce lawyer for instance.</p>

<p>People who needed to engage the services of a legal professional were no longer prepared to hand over hard-earned wages to a system they felt was rhetorical and grossly inflated. They sought services that were affordable but delivered efficient and transparent documentation that was legally binding. It was a tough nut to crack but it was cracked and before we knew it, consumers could finally afford a cutting edge strategy that allowed them to compete in an ever-growing technically advanced market and could do so with confidence.</p>

<p>As a result, legal technology skyrocketed into the next realm but so also did the chase to cash in on a multi-billion dollar market. However, although it is still early days the consensus states, simply through the indication of sheer numbers, that this industry may well experience an over-saturation in the coming years. Be that as it may.</p>

<p>It appears that whilst the internet was growing exponentially, so too was the legal system therein and research tools available became that one could use to process full-text searches. Next appeared a global online service for intellectual property that matched up entrepreneurs with attorneys who dealt with patents so their inventions could be protected.</p>

<p>And still the processes grew until small businesses were able to locate legal professionals in a timely manner saving not only valuable time that was crucial for advancement, but businesses were able to begin trading almost immediately. Then along came the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance. A website that made the law and all its jargon not only accessible but understandable. Consumers were celebrating and entrepreneurs were sagely nodding their heads.</p>

<p>At last, they knew someone understood their plight. Someone was making an effort and it became easier to make business lives a little more enjoyable. Although future trends threaten to dim the sunlight for this phase of the legal system and given there are many out there who, woe betide this new trend, are arguing the law should be kept inside the gates of the law professionals, it is an era for technical tradition. As the world grows to learn and learns to grow, it can do nothing more than accept that even the legal system must expand and allow the laymen to journey through their hallowed gates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People are beginning to understand and truly respect that startup legal advice is now not only a trend constructed to have its moment in the sun but the sun will be around to shine for many millenniums yet. You cannot refute the fact that this new era with all its technical innovation has introduced legal startups for a definitive purpose and the direction of legal access is now in session.</p>

<p>Understandably, the legal industry with everything it has on its plate has not been one that was equipped with forward-thinking. It has however been very protective of its profession and with the utmost care, shared-nothing before it was duly paid.</p>

<p>Now, with the future opening up to embrace equality, the industry is perhaps trembling on the verge of extinction for services it has exclusively enjoyed for centuries but is now at a turning point where even that is in a tailspin.</p>

<p>Innovation was at its most precedented, although much of it unimagined until recently, has given the all-clear for people who are passionate about the law and its intricate pathways a run for their well-earned money.</p>

<p>It clearly appears entrepreneurs, investors, and inventors have every conceivable opportunity to utilize what will happily be an equal legal opportunist world.</p>

<p>Laws will never vanish. Legal professionals will always be welcomed into the scheme, but it appears they will come from the same paths as those taken by entrepreneurs who sought these services in the first place. Only time will tell.</p>
